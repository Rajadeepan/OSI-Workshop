# OSI-Workshop
Artifacts related to OSI workship 2017

## Prerequisite:

This workshop will cover two agenda namely Docker and Kubernetes.  There is a lot to cover and hence
we request the participants to be ready with below prerequisite.  We will cover as much theory and
concepts that are possible with the available time.  Any basic understanding of Kubernetes or Distributed
systems in general will be really helpful


### Docker

	a) VM / Machine with root access
	b) Ubuntu 16.04
	c) At Least 2GB RAM
	d) At Least 10 GB Free HDD


### Kubernetes

	a) Need access to cloud infrastructure such as GCE, AWS or AZURE (GCE will be our chosen platform 
	   for demo/workshop).
	b) Some knowledge about operating the cloud environment such as creating VMs / Connecting to VMs/ 
	   Exposing it on public IP / Managing Disk.
	c) Some hands on in Linux Administration will come in very handy such as using `systemctl`.
	d) Recommended is 3 VMs but at least 2 VMs are required for the handson workshop.
	e) Recommended VM size (4CPU, 4GB RAM, 20GB HDD) preferably SDD. 
	
All the artifacts the are to be used and will be used for the workshop will be available in this github repository.
